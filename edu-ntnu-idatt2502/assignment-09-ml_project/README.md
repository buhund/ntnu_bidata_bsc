## Project assignment

#### Various Reinforcement Learning Tasks

Project suggestions:

- Choose an environment (e.g. from fra [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)) and test different algorithms.
- Choose an algorithm, and test it in different environments.
- Create an environment.
- Explore different configurations of an algorithm.itme

For this project, the choice fell on testing two different algorithms, PPO and DDQN, on the [gym-super-mario-bros](https://pypi.org/project/gym-super-mario-bros/) environment by [Christian Kauten](https://pypi.org/user/kautenja/). The primary goal of the implementation is to compare the two algorithms, in order to determine which has the better performance in learning to play Super Mario Bros.



## Requirements

- **Python 3.10**

Python packaged and dependencies for each algorithm implementation can be installed through `requirements.txt` inside each algorithm directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:buhund/idatt2502-assignment_09-ml_project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory

```
cd idatt2502-assignment_09-ml_project
```

Then navigate to an algorithm subdirectory

```
mario_ddqn
mario_dqn
mario_ppo
```



Create a new environment with Python 3.10.15 (Conda). For best compatibility, you may want to create one env for each algorithm, e.g. `mario_ppo` and `mario_ddqn`.

```
conda create -n mario_ppo python=3.10
```

```
conda create -n mario_ddqn python=3.10
```



Activate the new conda environment for either PPO or DDQN:

```
conda activate mario_ppo
```

```
conda activate mario_ddqn
```



Install required packages and dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Running the agents

### PPO

The agent have two modes: `train` and `test`.

Training mode will train the agent on the environment. This will write the policy updates to `agent.pth` and `critic.pth` files, which hold the latest best policy weights for navigating the environment.

Testing mode will load the `actor.pth` and `critic.pth`, and then run the agent in the environment however many times is set in the config file. This mode will not learn anything, nor update the `actor.pth` or `critic.pth` files. This is to test(!) how well the trained model performs after the training. The agent's performance will be logged to `logs/tensorboard/mario_ppo_testing/` and can be viewied in TensorBoard.

#### Run in terminal

The scripts run via terminal arguments. By invoking `python` on `main.py` and setting the `--mode` flagwith `train` or `test` arguments.

Navigate to the mario_ppo directory. From inside the main project directory, `idatt2502-assignment_09-ml_project`

```
cd mario_ppo/
```


##### Training:

```bash
python main.py --mode train
```

##### Testing:

```bash
python main.py --mode test
```



#### IDE

Alternatively, run main.py with `--mode test` arguments through your preferred IDE.



### DDQN

Use your preferred IDE to run `main.py`



## Config - PPO

In `config.py`, you have to specify the parameters for the agent, especially the number of episodes for training and testing, as well as checkpoint interval.

```python
# Environment config
WORLD = 1
STAGE = 1
ENV_VERSION = "v0"
ENV_NAME = f"SuperMarioBros-{WORLD}-{STAGE}-{ENV_VERSION}"
RENDER_MODE = True # True for visual gameplay, False for no visuals.

# Number of episodes to run
NUM_EPISODES = 30_000 # Episodes during training
NUM_TEST_EPISODES = 1_000 # Episodes during testing
# Checkpoint settings
CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL = 1000 # Checkpoint every X episodes
```

##### Rendering

To toggle displaying rendering, i.e. getting the window showing the agent playing Super Mario, you change the value `RENDER_MODE`:

- `True` to enable rendering
- `False` to disable rendering.



## TensorBoard logging



### PPO

To enable logging via TensorBoard, run the following from the `mario_ppo` dirctory:

Training logs

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/tensorboard/mario_ppo_training/
```

Testing logs

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/tensorboard/mario_ppo_testing/
```



### DDQN



## Errors



### OSError: 'GLIBCXX_3.4.32' not found

WARNING: You may very well break your user environment in some way by following the instructions under. Proceed at your own risk. You should probably not try this at home. Do it on your work laptop, where it doesn't matter if it breaks. This is also probably where Håkon would say to use Docker.



If you get the following error:

```bash
OSError: /lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.32' not found (required by /home/USER/miniconda3/envs/mario_ppo/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nes_py/lib_nes_env.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)
```



It can be fixed by installing the following:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11
```



Then check if `GLIBCXX_3.4.32` is installed:

```bash
strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX
```

This will print a list where you need to locate `3.4.32`. If it's there, you've got it.



You also likely will have to symlink this into your active venv:

```bash
ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libstdc++.so.6 
```



I assume this would work for a non-conda venv also, but I have no idea.
