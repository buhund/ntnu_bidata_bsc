Here be no triangular wheels, only round ones.

> Veldig godt prosjekt du leverer. Interaksjonsdesign-vedlegget ditt er bra, veldig lurt at du tar utgangspunkt i vell-etablerte løsninger som Apples notater-applikasjon. Det er veldig smart og sørger for at applikasjonen din oppnår høy standard. Applikasjonen din ser minimalistisk og god ut, veldig bra. Rapporten din er også veldig god, fint du lister opp en god mengde fordeler og ulemper for hver av alternativene, kjempe bra."


#### Demo of the app

## Requirements

- Java JDK 21
- Gradle
- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio
- Android Emulator or physical device
- Android SDK
- Android 15 "Vanilla Ice Cream" API level 35
- Flutter and Dart plugins for Android Studio


## Testing/Running the app

The simplest way to run the solution is to use an Android emulator through Android Studio.

Steps to run the app:
- Install Android Studio, Android SDK, Java JDK21, Flutter and Dart SDK.
- Unzip the file containing the source code into a suitable folder, e.g. `assignment_08_todo_project`
- Open Android Studio, and open the folder where you unzipped the code as a new project.
- Set up an emulator device (Medium Phone, API level 35, Android 15 "Vanilla Ice Cream") and start it via Device Manager by clicking the "Play" button (white-grey arrow).
- To run the app on the emulated device, press the large green "Play" button in the top right of the UI in Android Studio.
- The app should now be running on the emulator device.
- You can now interact with the app as you would on a physical device.
